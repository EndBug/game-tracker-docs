# Rainbow 6 Siege

The Rainbow Six Siege commands let you look up players from every platform and get their stats.

### Common options

The following options are present in every stats command:

- `username`: the username of the player you want to look up. It's not needed if you've already [linked](#r6-link) your account.
- `platform`: the platform of the player you want to look up. It's not needed if you've already [linked](#r6-link) your account.
- `user`: the guild member you want to look up. It can be used instead of `username` and `platform`, but will only work if that user has already [linked](#r6-link) their account.
